The implementation of Food-Ordering-App is done in Dart using the Flutter frameworks. The code is written in a modular way so that it can be easily expanded with additional funcionalities.

## Future Updates

The future versions of the apps aim to include a highly sophisticated search engine for the menu. The search engine will be able to search for food items by name, category, price, and other attributes. We also aim to implement a content-based recommendation system for the users to provide an enhanced UI experience.
